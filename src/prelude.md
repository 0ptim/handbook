# Prelude

## What's the goal of this handbook? 

To slowly start building this up: 

- Critical docs: How to update for exchanges, reindexes etc.
- Standard practices for coding, git, things like how to add a new data structure, add rpc, etc
- Testing: how to write a test and contribute (so we can welcome external contributions too), and release checks
- Links to pink paper, external resources of all kind (a dedicated page similar to github awesome-{x} repos.
- Anything that's doesn't belong in the source code or is process related.


## How do I read and write this handbook?

The book uses the simplest Markdown generator available, `mdbook` - intentionally.
No big features. It's simple. Any engineer should be able to learn and use it 
in minutes - not hours.
