# Using a wallet

This document will go over how to create a wallet and addresses in order to send and recieve DFI and dTokens.

## Using testnet

In this tutorial we will use the testnet network in order to prevent any possibility of financial loss. To use the testnet, stop the `defid` process, if any, and run it with the `-testnet` flag.

Linux and macOS: `.\defid -testnet`
Windows: `defid.exe -testnet`
